# dexterous-robotic-micro-hand
This project aims to develop a next-generation open-source dexterous robotic hand, inspired by human biomechanics. Designed for high-precision manipulation, force feedback, and scalable manufacturing, it targets robotics R&amp;D, intelligent automation, and real-world deployment.




Applications:

Assembly-line robots

Human-robot collaboration (HRC)

Machine learning robotic demos

Prosthetics and assistive robotics
